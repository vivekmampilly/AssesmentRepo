In this Project I am Using a Service which will run in background. Servcie will be getting started when activity is running. Data from service will updated to ViewModel and Viewmodel will update UI
This service will be monitoring car speed which will be fetched from CarManager availabe is AAOS platform. 
It is also assumed that there is another application with Car Rental Company which is connected to the same firebase database used by android service. Using this application Car rental company can change max speed for each car and monitor max speed reported from AAOS. Each car is identified by VIN NO.

Added Screenshots also.

Look for code in following path : AaosTestApp/app/src/main/java/com/test/netanalytiks
