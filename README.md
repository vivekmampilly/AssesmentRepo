# AssesmentRepo
In this Project I am Using a Service which will run in background. It is assuemed that Servcie will be getting started at the time of Android OS strtup.
This service will be monitoring car speed which will be fetched from CarManager availabe is AAOS platform. 
It is also assumed that there is another application with Car Rental Company which is connected to the same firebase database used by android service. Using this application Car rental company can change max speed for each car and monitor max speed reported from AAOS. Each car is identified by VIN NO.
